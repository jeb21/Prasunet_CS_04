# Keylogger Project

This is a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the `pynput` library. The keylogger captures key presses and writes them to a file named `keylogs.txt`.

## Features

- Logs key presses, including space, enter, backspace, tab, shift, ctrl, and alt.
- Detects and logs key combinations like `<CTRL+C>` and `<CTRL+V>`.
- Writes key logs to a file named `keylogs.txt`.
- Stops logging when the escape key (`esc`) is pressed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jeb21/Prasunet_CS_04.git
    ```

2. Install the required library:
    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the keylogger script:
    ```bash
    python Simple_Keylogger.py
    ```

2. The keylogger will start capturing key presses and writing them to `keylogs.txt` in the same directory.

3. To stop the keylogger, press the escape key (`esc`).

## Key Mapping

The keylogger maps special keys to specific strings in the `keylogs.txt` file:
- Space: ` `
- Enter: `\n`
- Backspace: `<BACKSPACE>`
- Tab: `<TAB>`
- Shift: `<SHIFT>`
- Ctrl: `<CTRL>`
- Alt: `<ALT>`

### Key Combinations
- Ctrl+C: `<CTRL+C>`
- Ctrl+V: `<CTRL+V>`
